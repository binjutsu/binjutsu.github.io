brief ctf notes:

1. run the binary like this:
ncat -l -k -e ./binary -p port

file the program to find out arch/OS
use checksec and find out the protections, they are a clue.

1. running binaries.

you can run a binary with: 

#!/bin/sh
# $1 = program $2 = port
ncat -l -k -e $1 -p $2

write the python exploit such that 
  s = socket.create_connection(('localhost', 1234))
  data = s.recv(200)

then set up as much as possible, right before the sending the payload
add a raw_input() to give you the time to attach gdb.

socat can also be used:
socat -lm -d -d TCP-LISTEN:1234,fork EXEC:./binary,stderr

TIL: bss segment variables do not change with ASLR
